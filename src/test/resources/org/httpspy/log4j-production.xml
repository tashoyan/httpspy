Priority order is DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL

PatternLayout conversion characters:

%c   Category of the logging event
%C   Fully qualified class name of the caller
%d   Date of the logging event  (example: %d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} )
%F   File name where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
%l   Location information of the caller (caution: extremely slow)
%L   Line number from where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
%m   Application-supplied message
%M   Method name from where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
%n   Line separator
%p   Priority of the logging event
%r   Number of milliseconds since the start of the application
%t   Name of the thread that generated the logging event
%x   Nested diagnotic context associated with the thread
%%   A single percent sign

Format modifiers examples:

%20c     Left pad with spaces if category is less than 20 characters long
%-20c    Right pad with spaces if category is less than 20 characters long
%.30c    Truncate from the beginning if category is more than 30 chars long
%20.30c  Left pad 20 chars + truncate from beginning if more than 30 chars
%-20.30c Right pad 20 chars + truncate from beginning if more than 30 chars

Examples:  "%r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m\n"
"%-6r [%15.15t] %-5p %30.30c %x - %m\n"
